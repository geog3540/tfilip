        <p class="card-text">This is a flowmap displaying the top 50 migration flows within Camobodia over a 5 year period. Nodes displayed on the map are centroid of districts within Camboaia. Flow maps using a tapered style was chosen so as to minimize visual clutter among densely packed regions of flows (e.g., around Phnom Penh). A diverging color scheme is used to highlight large flows (in shades of blues) from smaller flows (in shades of red). This color of flows was chosen to contrast the basemap of Camobodia displaying in grey hues the districts within Cambodia. Larger ends of the tapered/teardrop flows indicate flows moving inwards towards a node compared to outwards. Data from Koylu and colleagues supports the use of a teardrop design for accuracy of long flows towards a destination, which is why this design was used here to display most flows from all provinces in Cambodia. Additionally, the tapered end of the flow is visually used as well to highlight the inward flow of migration into a node. Interpretation of patterns: overall these data represent the urbanization of Cambodia in the flows from more remote outer regions of Cambodia into more dense urban environments. This can be seen in the large amount of flows moving towards Phnom Penh and Kampong Cham. More specificially, the southwest of Cambodia appears to see the largest change in migration with the largest number of people moving from rural areas into the cities. The node symbols do not provide additional information, but I am interested to put a base choropleth map on this map in the future to examine for example the risk of contracting malaria in these regions and the overlap of these flow patterns to determine which areas might be at increased risk for out breaks of disease (such as malaria or other infectious dieases).  </p>
